I award up to 8 points per answer. 50\% for Pass, 75\% for Pass with distinction. Deadline is 24 May at 17:00. Hand-in via Lisam.

\subsection{Hypothetico-Deductive Method}

\textbf{Question:} What is the hypothetico-deductive method, and what are its strengths and weaknesses with respect to its ability to verify and/or falsify hypotheses? Do you think science revolves around the use of the H-D method?

\bigbreak

\textbf{Answer:} In general it can be said that inductivism is preferred over deductivism as it leaves no doubts in the chain of logic once applied. Still deductivism is sometimes preferred over inductivism as inductivism is infeasible to apply under some cirumstances. The problem with applying inductivism is well described in Understanding Philosophy of Science from James Ladyman \cite[p. 40]{ladyman}: \say{Since it is logically possible that any regularity will fail to hold in the future, the only basis we have for inductive inference is the belief that the future will resemble the past.}

So it seems that it is not possible to use the true principles of induction, but science needs a way to circumvent this problem, otherwise it would be impossible to build any chain of validity. The resources for checking out all possibilities and outcomes are either too demanding or not possible at all. That's when the Hypothetico-Deductive methods comes in, as it shapes a way of handling this problem. It does not solve the problem direclty, but rather shows how to deal with a theory or hypothesis to still make it useful and applicable in science.

As it is easier to describe this method with an example, we will use the following logical statement throughout this answer to have a more comprehensible hypothesis: \say{All swans are black}.

Depending on where one looks up information about the Hypothetico-Deductive method, the methods consist of three or four steps.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Hypothesis
  \item Prediction
  \item Test of Predictions
\end{itemize}

Literature relying on four steps include, that for finding a hypothesis, previous knowledge and experience must be used and therefore results in an additional first step. Thus from a hypothesis is being phrased by observing a pattern that could be used to make predictions. In our example the hypothesis is, that all swans are black, presumably because the observer has only seen black swans so far. It is assumed that there is at least a strong hint towards the hypothesis and no obvious contradiction against it. Note that the method itself will also hold for a random hypothesis if the steps are correctly and thoroughly applied even if this leads to a larger rejection rate.

The presented hypothesis needs one crucial property which is that it must be falsifiable. It's important that this property is falsifiable by science in general (maybe in the future) as we otherwise leave no room for our hypothesis being invalid and thus making the method itself inapplicable for science. In our example, we could phrase a statement that if true, falsifies the hypothesis: \say{If we see at least one non-black swan, the hypothesis is wrong}.

The next step is that we use the hypothesis (in science mostly a theory) to make predictions and then either use them directly in a scientific context or further fortify the hypothesis. The latter one is usually done first to strengthen the hypothesis. When stating a hypothesis or theory it makes sense to try to falsify it, because if we fail doing so, we have strong assumption that the hypothesis is actually true. to some extend. Note that this method will never yield in evidence as long as we don't observe every possible outcome.

These trials in falsifying the hypothesis belong to the last step which is testing if the predictions hold. Keep in mind that this Hypothetico-Deductive method does not say anything about the usefulness of a theory or hypothesis. For instance we know that Newtons laws of motions are wrong from a scientific point of view, but that the predictions for low velocities are so close to the actual model of general relativity, that they are still incredible useful and widely used.

This shows that this method has some flaws as it does not include a measure of usefulness for instance. Also the assumption that the hypothesis must be falsifiable is not always given in applied science. If we take religions for an example, they mostly do not phrase a logical statement for falsifying them but are still accepted throughout the world. This tends towards assuming that  this method is not that useful, but I think that in a scientific context this method is a really good basement for getting started in creating a theory. Missing aspects like the mentioned usefulness are left for us humans to evaluate.

To conclude this answer I say that I agree that science in general evolves around this method but that there are many exceptions to this and the given hypothesis are not always clearly stated. If we look at research papers they rarely following this method in a direct way. Therefore I think that sciences evolves around the method, but does not strictly follow it.

\subsection{Scientific Paradigms}

\textbf{Question:} What is a scientific paradigm and how do they influence scientific practice? Is it good or bad that science is guided by paradigms? Do you think the programme you have chosen is schooling you into a particular programme?

\bigbreak

\textbf{Answer:} There exists no exact definition for the scientific paradigm but according to Kuhn there are two applications of scientific paradigms that can be identified: The paradigm as a \textit{disciplinary matrix} and the paradigm as an \textit{exemplar}. I will briefly discuss both of them.

\say{A disciplinary matrix is a set of answers to such questions that are learned by scientists in the course of the education that prepares them for research, [...]} \cite[p. 98]{ladyman}. So the disciplinary matrix is anticipated as a base to work with and is passed on over generations of scientists. The matrix consists of more or less explicit assumptions and aspects and a consensus exists that some explanations and ways of tackling problems are preferred over others. This distinguishes this paradigm from a theory. James Ladyman calls these specific skills, because that's what results from applying this paradigm over time, \textit{tacit knowledge} which is for example the skill to focus a telescope or experimental skills \cite[p. 99]{ladyman}.

The second application is being called \textit{exemplar} and tries to provide the skillset and models for handling future problems. For obtaining this skillset, well-known problems are given to the inexperienced scientists where they learn how to approach a new problem and the problem-solving process itself. This way they can use their obtained skillset, which is not necessarily the knowledge about the previous problems themselves, to make scientific progress in this specific domain of science.

The term \textit{normal science} refers to most science as it describes working within the field of a well-established paradigm according to Kuhn \cite[p. 100]{ladyman}. If the paradigm was checked thoroughly, this drastically reduces the amount of possibilities in the field of research. This utilisation of the paradigm can result in faster progress because usually this tends to less questioning. Nevertheless this is also susceptible in missing out solutions that are contrary to the currently accepted paradigm.

Sometimes we find a paradigm which is more useful then the previous one, so what do we do with the old one? Kuhn is critical to Poppers falsificationism \cite[p. 101]{ladyman} as Popper implies that scientists should abandon neglected theories and paradigms. I agree with Kuhn being critical as the earlier mentioned example about Newtons theory of motion are the perfect example where simply because a theory or paradigm is proven wrong it's not implied that it's useless.

So in case that a paradigm has too many serious flaws it happens that the paradigm is given up upon in favour of another. We have seen this in the past, albeit rarely. This is called \textit{Paradigm Shift}. We should also be aware that paradigms are sociological and psychological constructs. So I agree with James Ladyman when he says that paradigms are intellectual properties of rules (even though they do not have something like a right of ownership).

To conclude the question if paradigms are good or bad, I want to emphasise that I don't favour one side. The benefits are that paradigms mirror our human perception of the world, trying to simplify things to make them comprehendible. We rely on simplifications to function as humans, but it also raises the issue missing out on important aspects. Paradigms itself are not intended to be social constructs by default, but it lies in the human nature to shape them in a way that they are.

As we study Statistics we have these paradigms as well, the most common one probable the difference between the Bayesian and the Frequentist approach about observations and true believes. While the Bayesian way assumes that the data is given and the model parameters are to be set, the Frequentists assume that the model parameters are fixed and produce the data. Both have their benefits and are easier to apply in different areas.

\subsection{Falsifiability}

\textbf{Question:} What does it mean for a scientific hypothesis to be falsifiable, and: (i) why is it good that they are falsifiable, and (ii) why is even better that they can be falsified in many different ways?

\bigbreak

\textbf{Answer:} TBA.

\subsection{Theory-Dependency of Observation}

\textbf{Question:} In what way are observations theory-dependent, and why does that challenge the idea that hypotheses are generated inductively from observations?

\bigbreak

\textbf{Answer:} TBA.

\subsection{Difference between Natural and Human Sciences}

\textbf{Question:} What is the difference between the natural and the human sciences according to Ingthorsson? Include a reflection on what Ingthorsson says about the nature of the phenomena that the natural and human sciences study, and relate to what that nature implies about differences in method.

\bigbreak

\textbf{Answer:} TBA.

\subsection{Difference Between Science and Pseudo-Science}

\textbf{Question:} What is the difference between science and pseudo-science according to Sven-Ove Hansson, and why should we care?

\bigbreak

\textbf{Answer:} TBA.

\subsection{Being a Scientific Realist}

\textbf{Question:} What does it involve to be a scientific realist, and what reasons can we have for adopting that position? Do you think those reasons are convincing, and do think it would make any difference for you to take a realist or anti-realist approach to research in your discipline?

\bigbreak

\textbf{Answer:} TBA.
