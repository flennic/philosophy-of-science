\section{Assignments}

Please answer the following questions in essay format. Answers are graded on the basis of completeness and depth, not length, but as a rule of thumb 1–1,5 (+/- 20\%) pages per question should be about right. I award up to 8 points per answer. 50\% for Pass, 75\% for Pass with distinction. Deadline is 24 May at 17:00. Hand-in via Lisam.

\subsection{What are the researchers studying?}

\textbf{Notes:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Do the studied phenomena belong to the domain of the natural or the human sciences?
  \item Are they objectively measurable or subjectively evaluated?
  \item Are the methods used well suited to study the phenomena they are interested in?
\end{itemize}

\bigbreak

\subsection{Do you find that the articles reveal any particular view about what science is all about?}

\textbf{Notes:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Empirical/theoretical
  \item Testing of hypotheses/descriptive/exploratory
  \item Positivistic/falsificationist/hermeneutic
  \item Theory-dependent/independent
  \item Objective measurement/subjective interpretation
\end{itemize}

\bigbreak

\subsection{Do the articles reveal the authors’ views about knowledge?}

\textbf{Notes:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Data = fact
  \item Insight
  \item True justified belief / practically useful ideas/beliefs that are neither true or false
\end{itemize}

\bigbreak

\subsection{Are the authors self-critical to their arguments/hypotheses/ conclusions?}

\textbf{Notes:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Discuss sources of bias/confounders?
  \item Discuss alternative explanations?
  \item Are conclusions justified by their results?
\end{itemize}

\bigbreak

\subsection{Discuss whether the authors’ preunderstanding is reflected in the text, or do we have to speculate about it}

\textbf{Notes:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Do they refer to earlier research
  \item Do they refer to research that contradict them?
  \item Do they introduce relevant theories?
  \item Do they justify the validity of the method?
\end{itemize}

\bigbreak
